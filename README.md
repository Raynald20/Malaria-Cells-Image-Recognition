# Malaria-Cells-Image-Recognition
Classification of Malaria Cells Identification in Red Blood Cells Using Tensorflow.

The classification using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network as the classification model hypothesis).

The activation function is selected between three functions (PReLU, ReLU, and Leaky ReLU) based on the highest accuracy and f1 score.
